### Learning C Sharp (C#)

I know little about C# This section will go over all my current knowledge of the C# programming language.

#### Hello World in C Sharp (C#)

This is how you make a Hello World program in C# there is not much that can be changed.

```csharp
using System;

Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
```

#### Comments in C Sharp (C#)

Comments in C# are identical to comments in Java, JavaScript, C, CSS, Google Go, C++, etc..

```csharp
// This is a single line comment
/* This
is a multiline
comment */
/* Multi-line comments
* can also
* be written
* like this */
```

#### Break keyword in C Sharp (C#)

```csharp
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Classes in C Sharp (C#)

C# supports classes. The following is an example of classes in C#

```csharp
class myCSharpClass {
	static void main() {
		Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C# class");
		break;
	}
	return main();
	break;
}
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Return a function in C Sharp (C#)

C# supports the `return` keyword. The following is an example of returning a function in C#

```csharp
public void function1() {
	Console.WriteLine("A functional functioning function");
	break;
}
return function1();
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Integers in C Sharp (C#)

Integers in C# are similar in usage to that of Java, C, and C++ This is how you define them:

```csharp
int two = 2;
int sixteen = 16;
Console.WriteLine(two ** sixteen);
break;
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Exponentiation in C Sharp (C#)

This example is identical to the above example. It demonstrates how to exponentiate values in C#

```csharp
int two = 2;
int sixteen = 16;
Console.WriteLine(two ** sixteen);
break;
```

2^16 = 65,536. The program should return 65,536 (the maximum value of a 16 bit integer)

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Other knowledge of C Sharp (C#)

1. C# is a DOT NET framework language

2. C# is a language by Microsoft

3. C# is very similar to Java. Sometimes, it is commonly joked that C# is Microsoft Java

4. The only feature of C# I know that differentiates it from Java is boxing and unboxing, and the syntax

5. C# is named after the musical note Câ™¯ (C Sharp) and the language and the note are pronounced the same

6. Due to technical restrictions on webpages, the # usually has to be ommitted from the name of pages

7. C# uses the `*.cs` file extension

8. C# is a curly bracket and semicolon language

9. No other knowledge of the C# programming language
